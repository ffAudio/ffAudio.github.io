We contribute regularly to permissively licensed open source development. For an overview
you can have a look at our [github profile](https://github.com/ffAudio/){:target="_blank"}.

We will introduce you here to the most notable ones:


[foleys_gui_magic](/developer/pluginguimagic/) - A WYSWYG runtime JUCE GUI builder
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

foleys_gui_magic is a juce module you can add to your JUCE plugin or App.
It is sometimes referred to PluginGuiMagic. It allows
- styling all colours with hierarchical CSS entries
- layout your juce components
- add visualisers of your signal to the GUI
- add your own juce Components to the tree

For a more complete list have a look [here](/developer/pluginguimagic/).


[foleys_video_engine](/developer/videoengine/)
----------------------------------------------

We developed a video engine to be used in JUCE projects. The reading is done
using FFmpeg and the audio is piped into a JUCE audio pipeline.

More information can be found [here](/developer/videoengine/).
