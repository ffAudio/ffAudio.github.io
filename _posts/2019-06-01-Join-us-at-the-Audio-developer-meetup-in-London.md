title: Join us at the Audio Developer Meetup in London
---

Next week I will give a talk about our new [Video Engine](/developer/videoengine/).
The talk is presented by the [Audio Developer meetup](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/JUCE-Meetup/events/261777471).
Unfortunately there is contradicting information, if it is on Tuesday or Wednesday, 4th or 5th of June 2019, but in any case 6:30 pm.
I will edit here, as soon as I find out, which date is correct.

Please sign up at the [Skillsmatters page](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/12468-audio-developers-june-meetup), if you want to come.
