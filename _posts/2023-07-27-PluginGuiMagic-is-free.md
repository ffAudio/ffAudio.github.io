---

With the upcoming release of PluginGuiMagic 1.4.0 there is no longer a commercial license required.

The license for [foleys_gui_magic](https://github.com/ffAudio/foleys_gui_magic/) is now the permissive BSD-V3 3 clause for all use cases: open source, closed source, commercial and non commercial.

The repository got a little restructure: the module ot be included in your project is placed in the sub directory modules.    
In the repository the Examples from the former PluginGuiMagic repository is now included in the foleys_gui_magic repository and there are new unit tests in the Tests folder.

The build servers will run the tests and build the examples for every commit, you will see the build status on the README page.
