title: Video Engine for JUCE published
---

We are pleased to publish an early version of our all new [Video Engine](/developer/videoengine/).
It features a video processing pipeline, so you can use that to create video players, editors or other creative tools.

Finally a framework that is dedicated to allow manipulating audio AND video with the same tools and language.

You will be able to write your own video processors to easily enhance the repertoire.
