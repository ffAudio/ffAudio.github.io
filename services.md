Foleys Finest Audio offers consulting and contract development for the audio industry.


Technology Stack
----------------

Our primary focus is desktop development for music and audio applications. 
Our services start from planning through development up to the finished product.
And it doesn't stop there. We make sure your product is properly received at the users.
Investigation of unexpected behaviour or bugs, a proper update routine, integration
in web deployment systems are part of the finished product.

For programming we use several languages, mainly modern C++ but also Python, PHP and more.
We have experience with continuous integration and automatic testing to harness the code
and find breaking changes early on. We use github and github actions as well as our private
build machines.

The finished product will be deployed in a signed and notarised installer (depending
on the target platform) to avoid any irritation for your users from Apples Gatekeeper or
Windows Defender.

We also integrate into your platform to notify users of updates, create software 
activations and whatever your needs are.


Audio Frameworks
----------------

Most of our projects are done using [JUCE](https://juce.com), but not exclusively.
We also use QT as GUI framework and are continuously expanding our portfolio.

We deploy to many audio plugin formats, VST3, AudioUnit and ProTools AAX. Our AAX 
Plugins are signed with a qualified Avid signature for use with PACE iLok, so that they 
will run with no issues on ProTools systems.

Open Source
-----------

We developed various open source modules and products, that you can check out [here](/open-source).
