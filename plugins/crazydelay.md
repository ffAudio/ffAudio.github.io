*Available soon*

Foleys-Finest Audio created with CrazyDelay a new versatile rendition of the 60s tape delay effect, heard in many famous productions of that time. Moving the tape's playhead during playing lets you create the specific speed-up and slow-motion like effects, while controlled feedback leads to psychedelic sounds.
It is a great tool to enrich your front line or just to create ambience in the background.

But unlike the hardware original, you will not be limited by the fixed feedback chain, but you have the option to add up to four effects into the feedback chain, like a limiter, which is very handy in combination with the feedback, equalizing and compression. And we will add crushing effects in the future, like distortion, stereo panners and pitch.
