## Open Source

On our [github page](https://github.com/ffAudio/){:target="_blank"} there are a variety of open source resources, like metering components or an analyser.
We also have some little or sometimes bigger snippets, that we used to get a better understanding of the JUCE API. This is, how the open source [Frequalizer Free](https://github.com/ffAudio/Frequalizer/){:target="_blank"} came to life.

### ff_meters

This component fits into audio processing, it measures peak and RMS values and offers a Component to display a meter in a thread safe way.

- [ff_meters github](https://github.com/ffAudio/ff_meters/)

## Further projects

We start now to add more advanced engines and offer these on a dual licensing, for open source/private and commercial use. Stay tuned!

## JUCE

For our developments we use most of the times [JUCE](https://juce.com){:target="_blank"}, since it works best for our audio applications and plugins.
While developing, we often face pieces, that we need so often, that we create a reusable solution and publish it. We believe in an exchange between professionals, so we can learn from each other.
