## White Label and Bespoke Plugins

We offer all our plugins also as white label. 
Add the common functionality of equalizers, analysers, Compressors and other Plugins to your product to strengthen your brand value or round up a product package.

The designs will be adapted according to your designs and specifications. There is a variety of visualisation you can use. Some of them like seen in the Frequalizer Free are already developed, e.g. draggable EQ curves, or more specific variants can be implemented after your wishes.

## Custom DSP

Sometimes while working as an Audio Engineer, you come back to a specific workflow or combination of plugins.
We offer to create this workflow into a plugin of your own. Either for your personal use or to offer it as a signature series or even a giveaway from your studio.
