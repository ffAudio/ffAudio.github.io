Consulting the audio industry
=============================

Foleys Finest Audio develops audio tools, plugins and other building blocks to
make audio software better. With many years in the audio industry we developed
a modern style following best practices as they appear. We focus on solid and
well maintainable code in C++.


Integrating everywhere
======================

We have experience in all major DAWs and deploy in a diverse set of APIs.
Our portfolio covers VST, Apple (tm) AudioUnits and AVID (tm) AAX plugins.

Our software is designed to run on Windows PCs, Apple computers as well as
mobile platforms like iOS and Android. We also run Linux computers and develop
software for Linux.


Modules for Audio Development
=============================

For audio developers we offer libraries and JUCE modules for GUI design/WYSWYG 
editing and audio visualisation. We also develop a video framework to make
video editing within JUCE audio applications possible.

Some of our modules are available for free and open source, some require a
license to be used in commercial products.
